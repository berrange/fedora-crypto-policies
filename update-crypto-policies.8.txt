update-crypto-policies(8)
=========================
:doctype: manpage
:man source: update-crypto-policies


NAME
----
update-crypto-policies - manage the policies available to the various
cryptographic back-ends.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*update-crypto-policies* ['COMMAND']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
update-crypto-policies(8) is used to set the policy applicable for the
various cryptographic back-ends, such as SSL/TLS libraries. That will
be the default policy used by these back-ends unless the application user
configures them otherwise.

The available policies are restricted to the following profiles.

* LEGACY: ensures maximum compatibility with legacy systems (64-bit
  security)

* DEFAULT: A reasonable default for today's standards (80-bit security).

* FUTURE: A level that will provide security on a conservative level that is
  believed to withstand any near-term future attacks (112-bit security).

* EMPTY: All cryptographic algorithms are disabled (used for debugging only)

The desired system policy is selected in /etc/crypto-policies/config
and this tool will generate the individual policy requirements for
all back-ends that support such configuration. After this tool is called
the administrator is assured that any application that utilizes the
supported back-ends will policy that adheres to the configured profile.

The generated back-end policies will be placed in /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends.
Currently the supported back-ends are:

* GnuTLS library

* OpenSSL library

* NSS library

* OpenJDK

* Libkrb5

* BIND

[[options]]
OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available in update-crypto-policies tool.

* --show:       Shows the currently applied crypto policy

* --is-applied: Returns success if the currently configured policy is
                already applied.

* --no-check:   By default this tool does a sanity check on whether the configured policy
                is accepted by the supported tools. This option disables those checks.


[[compatibility]]
COMPATIBILITY
-------------
Policies that were present in previously released Fedora systems will
be available using the @FXX suffix, where XX is the Fedora version. For
example the LEGACY policy in Fedora 21 will also be available as LEGACY@F21.


[[appsupport]]
APPLICATION SUPPORT
-------------------
Applications shipped by Fedora that provide a default configuration file
that includes a cryptographic policy string will be modified gradually to
support these policies.

When an application provides a configuration file, the changes needed to
utilize the system-wide policy are the following.

* Applications using GnuTLS: The special priority string "@SYSTEM" should replace any other priority string.

* Applications using OpenSSL: The special cipher string "PROFILE=SYSTEM" should replace any other cipher string.

* Applications using NSS: No special treatment is required. Applications using NSS will load the crypto policies by default.

* Applications using Java: No special treatment is required. Applications using Java will load the crypto policies by default.

In all cases if the application isn't using a particular setting, e.g.,
using gnutls_priority_set_default() in GnuTLS, or no specific cipher string setting in
OpenSSL, no other changes are required. The system-wide string will be used
automatically.


[[policyconfig]]
POLICY CONFIGURATION
--------------------
One of the supported profiles should be set in /etc/crypto-policies/config
and this script should be run afterwards.

In case of a parsing error no policies will be updated.

FILES
-----
/etc/crypto-policies/config::
	The file contains the current system policy. It should contain a string of one of the profiles listed above (e.g., DEFAULT).

/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends::
	Contains the generated policies in separated files, and in a format readable by the supported back-ends.

/etc/crypto-policies/local.d::
	Contains local administrator additions, which are directly appended to the back-end config files when updated. The file names in this directory should match those in the back-ends directory and their content be in the back-end specific format.
